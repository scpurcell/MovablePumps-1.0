Makes moisture pumps reinstallable/uninstallable.  When the pump is moved 
the area size is reset to one tile.

This leads to an easy exploit; if you just keep moving the pump it clears 
the tile where you install it immediately.  This is likely why they were 
not meant to be moved.  I'm not going to tell you how to play, but that 
exploit was not my intent.

This should be safe to install or remove on an existing save.</description>
